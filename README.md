# E-Asset-Verification

The E-Asset Verification System (AVS) is designed to help asset officers/faculties and laboratory
supervisors manage their assets more efficiently and effectively in an organization (RVCE). 

The system allows to 
- upload an asset excel file from the SAP thereby generating barcode for each asset and maintaining a database for the asset details, 
- aims to make tracking the assets at different locations of a department faster by scanning the
BARCODE code on the asset using a smartphone and report generated for each time the
verification is done.
- The system also maintains the details of various companies whose assets are being used in the department and 
- keeps a track on which and how many times a particular asset has gone for service or is in servicing phase.
